    """Setup tus protocol server implementation for aiohttp.web application.

    It is a cornerstone of ``aiohttp-tus`` library and in most cases only thing
    developers need to know for setting up tus.io server for aiohttp.web application.

    :param app: :class:`aiohttp.web.Application` instance
    :param upload_path:
        :class:`pathlib.Path` instance to point the directory where to store uploaded
        files. Please, esnure that given directory is exists before application start
        and is writeable for current user.

        It is possible to prepend any ``match_info`` param from named URL.
    :param upload_url:
        tus.io upload URL. Can be plain as ``/uploads`` or named as
        ``/users/{username}/uploads``. By default: ``"/uploads"``
    :param upload_resource_name:
        By default ``aiohttp-tus`` will provide auto name for the upload resource, as
        well as for the chunk resource. But sometimes it might be useful to provide
        exact name, which can lately be used for URL reversing.
    :param allow_overwrite_files:
        When enabled allow to overwrite already uploaded files. This may harm
        consistency of stored data, cause please use this param with caution. By
        default: ``False``
    :param decorator:
        In case of guarding upload views it might be useful to decorate them with
        given decorator function. By default: ``None`` (which means **ANY** client will
        able to upload files)
    :param on_upload_done:
        Coroutine to call after upload is done. Coroutine will receive three arguments:
        ``request``, ``resource`` & ``file_path``. Request is current
        :class:`aiohttp.web.Request` instance. Resource will contain all data about
        uploaded resource such as file name, file size
        (:class:`aiohttp_tus.data.Resource` instance). While file path will contain
        :class:`pathlib.Path` instance of uploaded file.
    :param json_dumps:
        To store resource metadata between chunk uploads ``aiohttp-tus`` using JSON
        files, stored into ``upload_path / ".metadata"`` directory.

        To dump the data builtin Python function used: :func:`json.dumps`, but you
        might customize things if interested in using ``ujson``, ``orjson``,
        ``rapidjson`` or other implementation.
    :param json_loads:
        Similarly to ``json_dumps``, but for loading data from JSON metadata files.
        By default: :func:`json.loads`
    :param upload_url_prefix:
        It is useful when you want to use this app as a sub_app. Example prefix:
        ``/api/v1``. By default: ``""``
